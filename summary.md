exponential time: O(2^n)

polynomial time: O(n^2)

shortest path

    weighted graph (edges have weights)

        shortest path is minimum sum of weights

    unweighted graph (edges do not have weights)

        shortest path: number of edges

        shortest path: bread first search 


graphs

    DFS: stack

    BFS: queue
