sorting

    in-place
        
        rearrange, so don't have to copy data into another data structure

        usually higher run-time but lower space complexity

    not in-place

        copy data into another data structure

        usually lower run-time but greater space complexity

types

    bubble sort

        naive approach

        run-time: 
            
            average case: (n-1)(n-1) = n^2 + 2n + 1 => O(n^2)

            best case: O(n) if only 1 number needed to be bubbled up or already in correct order
            
        space complexity: O(1) bc don't need extra data structures

    merge sort

        divide and conquer

        lower run-time, greater space compexity
