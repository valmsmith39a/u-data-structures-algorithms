Dynamic Programming

    Problem: Max value for weight limit

    Subproblem: Max value for some smaller weight

    Base case:  smallest computation 

Lookup table

    Stores solutions to subproblems 

    Ex stored tha max value for different weight limits in lookup table 

    Solve solution for trivial case, store solution in lookup table 

    Equation used at each step as I add complexity 

    Memoiztion => storing pre-computed values 

How to identify a problem with dynamic programming solution

     subproblems
