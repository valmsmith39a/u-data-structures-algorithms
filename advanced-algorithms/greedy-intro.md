Greedy Algorithms use Greedy Technique

Greedy Technique:

    Follow the best possible solution at each step of the algorithm

    May not be the most effective at all times, but some cases following greedy techniques result in best overall strategy

Some famous greedy algorithms:

    1. Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
    2. A * search Algorithm
    3. Prim's Algorithm for Minimal Spanning Tree
    4. Kruskal's algorithm for Minimal Spanning Tree
    5. Knapsack problem
    6. Traveling Salesman problem

Summary:
    1. In Greedy technique, we go for the best possible solution at each step of the algorithm
    2. Greedy solution may not be the most effective solution for the problem because we are not considering future scenarios(only the best choice at each step)
